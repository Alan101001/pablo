      <p>
        A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of
        buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent
        ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a
        public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately,
        such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through
        equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment is usually made with an
        investment strategy in mind.

          <h3>Lesson 1: what is a stock and a share ?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            A stock is a small part of the ownership of a company. Stock owner
            have a claim on the company’s assets and earnings. The more stock an
            investor buys the bigger his part on the company ownership. The
            stock of an incorporated business constitutes the equity stake of
            its owners. It represents the residual assets of the company that
            would be due to stockholders after discharge of all senior claims
            such as secured and unsecured debt. Stockholders’ equity cannot be
            withdrawn from the company in a way that is intended to be
            detrimental to the company’s creditors.
          </p>

          <h3>share</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The stock of a corporation is partitioned into shares, the total of
            which are stated at the time of business formation. Additional
            shares may subsequently be authorized by the existing shareholders
            and issued by the company. In some jurisdictions, each share of
            stock has a certain declared par value, which is a nominal
            accounting value used to represent the equity on the balance sheet
            of the corporation. In other jurisdictions, however, shares of stock
            may be issued without associated par value.

          <h3>stock trading</h3>

          <p>
            Stock trading happens when you buy or sell this rights you have to
            someone else (can be done using the stock market or not).

          <br />
          <p>
            The size of the world stock market was estimated at about $36.6
            trillion at the beginning of October 2008. The total world
            derivatives market has been estimated at about $791 trillion face or
            nominal value, 11 times the size of the entire world economy. The
            value of the derivatives market, because it is stated in terms of
            notional values, cannot be directly compared to a stock or a fixed
            income security, which traditionally refers to an actual value.
            Moreover, the vast majority of derivatives ‘cancel’ each other out
            (i.e., a derivative ‘bet’ on an event occurring is offset by a
            comparable derivative ‘bet’ on the event not occurring). Many such
            relatively illiquid securities are valued as marked to model, rather
            than an actual market price. The stocks are listed and traded on
            stock exchanges which are entities of a corporation or mutual
            organization specialized in the business of bringing buyers and
            sellers of the organizations to a listing of stocks and securities
            together. The largest stock market in the United States, by market
            capitalization, is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In Canada,
            the largest stock market is the Toronto Stock Exchange. Major
            European examples of stock exchanges include theAmsterdam Stock
            Exchange, London Stock Exchange, Paris Bourse, and the Deutsche
            Börse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange). In Africa, examples include
            Nigerian Stock Exchange, JSE Limited, etc. Asian examples include
            the Philippine Stock Exchange, the Singapore Exchange, the Tokyo
            Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock
            Exchange, and the Bombay Stock Exchange. In Latin America, there are
            such exchanges as the BM&F Bovespa and theBMV. Australia has a
            national stock exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange, due to
            the size of its population. Market participants include individual
            retail investors, institutional investors such as mutual funds,
            banks, insurance companies and hedge funds, and also publicly traded
            corporations trading in their own shares. Some studies have
            suggested that institutional investors and corporations trading in
            their own shares generally receive higher risk-adjusted returns than
            retail investors.

          <h3>Lesson 2:Stock market index</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            A stock index or stock market index is a method of measuring the
            value of a section of the stock market. It is computed from the
            prices of selected stocks (typically a weighted average). It is a
            tool used by investors and financial managers to describe the market
            and to compare the return on specific investments. An index is a
            mathematical construct, so it may not be invested in directly. But
            many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds attempt to “track” an
            index , and those funds that do not may be judged against those that
            do. Two of the most famous indexes are NASDAQ and NYSE:

          <p>
            The NASDAQ Stock Market, commonly known as the NASDAQ, is an
            American stock exchange. It is the second-largest stock exchange in
            the world by market capitalization, after the New York Stock
            Exchange. The exchange platform is owned by NASDAQ OMX Group, which
            also owns the OMX stock market network.

            rooms used for the facilitation of trading. A fifth trading room,
            located at 30 Broad Street, was closed in February 2007. The main
            building, located at 18 Broad Street, between the corners of Wall
            Street and Exchange Place, was designated a National Historic
            Landmark in 1978, as was the 11 Wall Street building.

          <h3>Bonds</h3>
          <p>
            a bond is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the
            holders. It is a debt security, under which the issuer owes the
            holders a debt and, depending on the terms of the bond, is obliged
            to pay them interest (the coupon) or to repay the principal at a
            later date, termed the maturity. Interest is usually payable at
            fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often
            the bond is negotiable, i.e. the ownership of the instrument can be
            transferred in the secondary market. Thus a bond is a form of loan
            or IOU: the holder of the bond is the lender (creditor), the issuer
            of the bond is the borrower (debtor), and the coupon is the
            interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance
            long-term investments, or, in the case of government bonds, to
            finance current expenditure.Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short
            term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments
            and not bonds: the main difference is in the length of the term of
            the instrument. Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major
            difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an
            equity stake in the company (i.e. they are owners), whereas
            bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (i.e. they are
            lenders). Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined
            term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks
            may be outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable
            bond, such as Consols, which is a perpetuity, i.e. a bond with no
            maturity.
